First, thank you for contributing to Ushahidi - thousands of
groups use this platform worldwide, and your work will help benefit all of
them.

Ushahidi is an open source web application. It collects information
from SMS, Twitter (pending), RSS feeds, Email and direct reports to a
platforms website. It helps users process that information, categorize it,
geo-locate it, visualise it and publish it on a map.

Ushahidi v3 is a rebuild from the ground up -- not only the code but
the way in which we think about users interacting with mobile and social data.

The ushahidi platform stack is:

  * Back-end: [Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), [PHP](https://php.net), [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/)/[Nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/Main), [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com) or [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org)

  * Front-end: [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org), [Javascript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [Html](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets). Built with [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) and [Browserify](http://browserify.org/). Using [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) for mapping, and a collection of other frontend libraries

Ushahidi will run on any platform that supports PHP, including Linux,
Mac OSX and Windows.
