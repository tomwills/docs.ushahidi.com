You’ve prepared the platform. Now comes the part that requires management skills.

Launching your Ushahidi instance is more than opening the server to the public. More than 90% of the work happens during the management of the data flows into and out of the platform.

This chapter will help you prepare for this management process, develop an organizational design for your team (however small), hire and train your staff, and get data flowing into v3. The next chapter will focus on curating the content.

## Preparation

Ushahidi can run on a variety of technology platforms (see Chapter on Installating). But the technology is only part of what you need to prepare to deploy an Ushahidi instance. To run Ushahidi you also need to assemble a team to keep instance running and to manage the data. This team will include technologists, analysts, and (likely) several working groups of volunteers.

### Technology Preparation

When you installed your server, you may have installed the software on a temporary server to allow you to play with the tools. The deployment requires a different setup. In some remote places, you may be running Ushahidi using a Nokia 1100 to connect the platform to the cellular network. In cities, you may need to find an elastic server that can quickly deal with spikes in traffic not only of inbound data, but views from the public. If you are setting up a small network of sensors around a river bed, your loads will not be the same as an election monitoring effort that hits the national TV reports or is announced as a trending hashtag on the Twitter homepage.

You should sit down with a technologist and plan out the potential scenarios that could happen with data collection. The question you will need to ask is if you need to hire a technologist to be part of your team. Simple installations may need someone to get you started and be on call for occasional glitches and gremlins. More complex or sensitive deployments may need someone to be watching over the server, managing the inevitable string of questions and data queries from analysts, and monitoring and protecting the system from cyberattack.

### Staffing Preparation

Staffing an Ushahidi instance depends on its size, complexity, and duration. Crisis response programs will start as an intense effort to collect as much data as possible, requiring outreach to the affected population as well as myriad volunteers and staff to manage the instance. Human rights campaigns have a different tempo, but also require staff and volunteers who can be trusted with information that may bring harm to those who contribute to the effort as well as communities under threat.

The typical structure of an Ushahidi deployment breaks down in working groups with a core team:

#### Core Team

* Project Manager: the person who is in charge of the overall strategy and management of the initiative.
* Volunteer Manager: the person(s) who are in charge of volunteer recruitment, training, scheduling, and retention.
* Technologist: the persons in charge of the Ushahidi platform, the server environment, and any other technology running the project.
* Analyst: the persons responsible for turning data into insights.

#### Working Groups

* Media Monitoring Team: identifies and monitors social media feeds, extracting actionable information.
* Translation Team: translates reports from local languages into the core language of the deployment, sometimes with help from groups like Translators without Borders.
* SMS Team: monitors information received through SMS
* Emergency Team: a small team designated to handle any report which requires urgent action.
* GeoLocation Team: identifies the location mentioned in each report and plots it on a map, usually with a GPS point.
* Report Team: provides first quality control monitoring: confirms that each report is correctly translated, geolocated, and is not a duplicate.
* Verification Team: assesses the veracity of each report, in close cooperation with the Media Monitoring and SMS teams.
* Technology Team: ensures that the platform and associated technologies support the efforts of the deployment.
* Analysis and Research Team: analyzes Posts and Messages and provides situation reports, often with data visualizations.

## Hiring Your Team

Your team will be critical to your success.

### Volunteers

Traditional wisdom says that you should find people with a passion for an issue for your volunteers. This adage remains true, but passion will not sustain volunteers through a tough campaign. They need an incentive beyond their passion to submit or process reports, day after day. It is prudent to pay them some amount, even if small, so that they know that they are valued and that work is expected each day.

Seek out volunteers who have skills that you need for your working groups. Bright, technologically curious

## Feedback Loops

### Creating a Feedback Loop
Collecting information into platform is only half the battle, how will you communicate information with your audience(s)? Partners? Media?

(migrate) think about how your partners and audience communicate now? What are they comfortable using to communicate? (cell phones, sms, internet) What do they have access to and can afford? How will people see the maps? during crisis? What is the most common form of communication?
feedback and information sharing in insecure environments

Monitoring: are you reaching your goals? Linked to objectives/goals? not tech, but programmatical goals?

1.    Example: Media Focus on Africa “The people who Media Focus on Africa Foundation are targeting do not have Internet access - We want to bring the results back to the people using mass media.” As a result of MFAF’s goals, Internet is only one part of the larger project and campaign. This is not only true for the Unsung Peace Heroes campaign but for all of MFAF’s work. Butterfly Works uses multiple media types in their work as well so the multimedia approach for Unsung Peace Heroes was familiar to both organizations and important to achieving their goals. Butterfly Works and MFAF used a multimedia approach, including a website, newspaper ads, radio and television appearances, participation in live events and word-of-mouth. (Melissa Tully)
2.    think about how your audience commonly views/accesses information)- and what way they are most likely to view information during a crisis
3.    What it is fundamental here is that you have to decide how and if you will return the information to those who provided reports so that they can use it for decision making or program intervention, in addition to take into consideration and maximize local information sharing formats, customs, and opportunities.
