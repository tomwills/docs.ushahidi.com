What is Ushahidi?
-----------------

| Ushahidi is an open source web application for information collection,
| visualization and interactive mapping. It helps you to collect info
  from: SMS,
| Twitter, RSS feeds, Email. It helps you to process that information,
| categorize it, geo-locate it and publish it on a map.

What is Ushahidi v3 ?
---------------------

| Ushahidi has had the same platform code base for 5 years. In 2012 we
  spent the
| time to do very deep user experience research within our user base,
  our
| developer base, and our own team in order to build a new, better
  Ushahidi core
| platform. We call it "v3".

| Ushahidi v3 is the next iteration of this tool, rebuilt from the
  ground up --
| not only the code but the way in which we think about users
  interacting with
| mobile and social data.

| Crowdsourcing strategies have come a long way in the five years
  Ushahidi has
| been around and we've been fortunate enough to learn a lot from our
  global
| community.

Why rebuild?
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Fragile tech. Many bugs and an obselete tech stack.. Ushahidi 2.x has
   been hard to maintain, some of the early foundation work was a bit
   shaky, and has thrown up many bugs. This is made worse because the
   framework we built on is now deprecated and unmaintained
-  The use case has changed (Grown!) - Ushahidi 2.x was built to map
   reports of violence in Kenya after the post-election fallout at the
   beginning of 2008. Now Ushahidi is used to monitor elections, track
   pollution, report corruption, manage disaster response/recovery and
   much more.

| Uses have grown beyond just a simple crisis mapping tool to a full
  fledged
| management platform for crowdsourced data. With this in mind, we
  decided to
| build a more versatile tool that can be easily configured for data
  collection
| and visualization.

| The purpose of v3 (The next generation of the platform) is to provide
  a better
| crowdsourcing platform, so that the leaders, crisis responders,
  funders, and
| decision making organizations can do their work more efficiently,
  gather
| better information, and understand whats happening on the ground. It
  is a data
| collection platform that makes gathering and organizing data easy. It
  is a
| mobile first platform, as always, thinking of people with simple
  phones and
| moving up to those with web access for a beautiful visual feel.

Key Improvements:

-  v3 is designed to support all types of social good activities, not
   simply crises.
-  Mobile first, responsive user interface.
-  Better, deeply integrated custom forms (post types)
-  Customisable workflows: create a set of steps that match your
   workflow

Should I use Ushahidi v3 for my new project?
--------------------------------------------

That depends.. we've `released
v3 <https://github.com/ushahidi/platform/releases>`__ to the public and
it should be usable in production. However it's still missing a few
features we had in v2. We recommend you give it a try and see if it
meets your needs. If somethings missing let us know! It helps us
prioritise future development

I'm a developer, should I contribute to Ushahidi v3?
----------------------------------------------------

Yes! Development moves pretty quickly but the tech stack is getting more
and more stable. If you're keen to help build something awesome, `Jump
